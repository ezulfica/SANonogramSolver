Nonogram Solver using Simulated Annealing

I will try to present the funniest project i have done. It's about using Simulated Annealing with nonogram to solve them.
The thing is, with nonogram. If we set : 
- n = numbers of rows * numbers of columns
- k = numbers of black cells

We can make a lot of combination before solving it, precisely : <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ezulfica/SANonogramSolver/main/img/binom.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

TODO : 
- Write the README
- optimize the code with some C/C++ loops to make it faster when the dimension is growing. 
- 
Since it's using simulated annealing method, it is possible to not obtain the solution, or it takes a lot of times.
