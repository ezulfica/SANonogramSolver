# SANonogramSolver
Nonogram Solver using Simulated Annealing


TODO : 
- Write the README
- optimize the code with some C/C++ loops to make it faster when the dimension is growing. 
- 
Since it's using simulated annealing method, it is possible to not obtain the solution, or it takes a lot of times.
